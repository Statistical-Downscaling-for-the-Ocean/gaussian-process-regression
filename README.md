This repository contains the code related to a gaussian process regression approach to filling in Line-P data.

# Line P Seasonal Trend Fitting

Fitting seasonal cycles and linear trends to Line P ocean timeseries data using least-squares optimization with uncertainty quantification.

**Purpose:** Educational example for the Line P Hackathon (Dec 2025)

---

## 📋 Overview

This repository contains implementations (Python & MATLAB) for analyzing ocean timeseries data:

- **Fit a model:** constant + linear trend + annual seasonal cycle
- **Estimate uncertainties:** via covariance matrix propagation
- **Visualize results:** 1000 Monte Carlo realizations of the fitted model
